Occasionally cells will be copied into additional locations when performing operations over large selection.
Probably something within handsontable.populateFromArray (ctrl+f "Disabled the nature of handsontable wrapping")
When saving assignments to local storage, the type of cell format is saved inside an array of arrays for undo/redo and this array can
increase in size infinitely and is not cleared. Should probably flatten the indexed arrays to the last index and first index(first index is always cell formatting).
Also, mobile click events need to be rechecked after changing source files for multiple instances because the main developer does not have a mobile device and touch events have been tested on desktop and mobile phone emulators.
